Raspberry Pi 4 ShaderToy
========================
By Tim Skillman, July 2019



Over 100 shaders modified to test the Raspberry Pi 4 OpenGLES 3.0 shaders.  
All shaders with ShaderToy links to their respective authors in the shader code.

Go to https://www.shadertoy.com/ for more information.


Setup:

- You will need at least 64Mb (128Mb recommended) reserved for the GPU
- You will need to download the SDL 2 libraries for the demo to work (from a terminal window) ...

  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev




Usage:

Unzip and execute the ShaderToy file ...

 - Double-click 'ShaderToy' (you may need to allow full permissions to run the executable)
 - Run ShaderToy from the terminal window by navigating to the folder and entering;

   ./ShaderToy

   (again, make sure the file has full permissions to run if it doesn't)

Press the SPACEBAR to navigate to the next shader
Press ESCAPE to exit

Notes:

Note1: Please wait for some shaders to load (such as Beehive/RandomPipe and others)
Note2: Some shaders use the mouse to interact and/or look around
Note3: Will ONLY work on a Raspberry Pi 4
